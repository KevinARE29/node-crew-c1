# NodeJS Crew Challenge 1

## Description

Create a simple Node RESTful api with 2 endpoints that allows upload/download of a file.

The file types that should be allowed to be uploaded:

- Doc types (word, excel and pdf )
- Images ( jpeg and png )

The api should store the files in a folder in the project root directory or volume if using docker, the files in the folder should be encrypted and unreadable in the folder.

The file should be readable only when it is downloaded using the download endpoint.

When the file uploaded is an image, then the api should create a thumbnail of the file, the thumbnail should be encrypted too and be downloadable using the endpoint. This means that for image upload the API should store 2 files in disk.

## Before Install

Make sure you have NodeJS, npm, Docker and docker-compose installed.

Before install our project, env variables must be set.

<center>

| Environment Variable Key | Environment Variable Value   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| PORT                     | 3000                         |
| NODE_ENV                 | [dev, staging, production]   |
| AES_KEY                  | [The AES Key for encryption] |
| AES_IV                   | [The AES IV for encryption]  |

</center>

Both setups, docker and local, will be shown here.

## Installation

#### Local

```bash
$ npm i
```

#### Docker

```bash
$ docker-compose build
```

## Running the app

Make sure the env variables are correct.

#### Local

```bash
# production
$ npm run start

# development
$ npm run start:dev
```

#### Docker

In this case, it only runs in development mode

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

## Test

#### Local

Running tests

```bash
# run all tests only once
$ npm run test

# run tests with a watcher
$ npm run test:watch
```

### Docker

There are two options to run the tests with Docker. They can be called from the outside of the container, or they can be called from the inside the bash console of container.

_Outside of the container_

```bash
# run all tests only once
$ docker-compose run api npm run test

# run tests with a watcher
$ docker-compose run api npm run test:watch
```

_Inside of the container_

First, enter to bash console

```bash
$ docker-compose run api bash
```

Inside of the container run the same commands as they are being ran in local.

```bash
# run all tests only once
$ npm run test

# run tests with a watcher
$ npm run test:watch
```
